 - ### Data Validation

### üîç Filtered List

- **Enhanced Data Validation**: Implementing the filtered list as a data validation rule under the `Job Title`, `Country`, and `Type` option in the Data tab ensures:
  - User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
  - Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
  - Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced
